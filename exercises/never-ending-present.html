	<p>The temporality of the internet comes from the user, the creator and the content.<br><br>Posting on social media, documenting every moment of the their life.<br>It’s not a private timeline, there is nothing private about the internet.<br>Their content not only documents the sequence of their life, but also the sequence of a collective life.<br>Culture dictates how a user interacts with the internet.<br>The topics of that day remain frozen in the string of characters the user leaves behind.<br>Time stamps keep these moments organized.<br>User’s individual reactions and opinions to the time’s topics remains imprinted on an infinite frieze.<br> However, the validity of this timeline should come into question.<br>The moments uploaded are a facade of an ideal life they wish the public to see.<br> They do not capture life’s messiness and mistakes.<br> <br>The creator on the other hand can demonstrate those mistakes.<br> Every update of a website admits fault in the previous design.<br> By nature of the idea of improvements, there has to be a problem at hand.<br> These mistakes are covered and left behind. </p>
