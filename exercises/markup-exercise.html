    <h2>(Soma)tic Poetry Rituals: The Basics in 3 Parts</h2>

    <br>
    <h4>1: Create Your Ritual</h4>
    <p>(Soma)tic Poetry Rituals are a different kind of investment in the everyday.<br>
       If you hate your job, for instance, you can build a ritual to be inside this<br>
       space that can reveal the unexpected and make a poem through the previously<br>
       unexplored aspects of the work environment. If you have a job you dislike,<br>
       that is entirely too many hours of your short life to waste. Hours you are never<br>
       going to get back. For over a decade I have been building personalized rituals<br>
       with people who hate their jobs and, <a href="https://somaticpoetryexercises.blogspot.com/2019/10/a-manifesto-introduction-to-somatic_9.html">so far there is no job where a ritual</a> is <br>
       not possible.</p>
    <p>If you have an unpleasant job, or if there is anything boring or annoying in<br>
      your life that you have to do but hate to do, please consider building a ritual<br>
      inside that space. If you can get yourself to create in such an area, then you<br>
      are free to create anywhere, any time. There is no place and no time where the<br>
      poems are not possible. 95% of poets eventually stop writing, and I believe it<br>
      is due to the stresses of our culture of work and the many forms of normalized<br>
      compliance we deal with. Each new responsibility tries to shave off more of our<br>
      jagged edges. I believe in your creativity and your ability to find the strength<br>
      in it and to live more fully, to not be yet another person who says that they<br>
      used to write poems, used to be creative. Let us always talk about creativity<br>
      in the present tense in our lives.</p>
    <p>Keep it as simple as possible at the start. The simpler the first ritual, the<br>
      more likely you are going to be willing to do it every day. It could be as simple<br>
      as writing for five minutes before work, five minutes in the middle of the workday<br>
      in the toilet, and five minutes after work.</p>
    <p>Once you begin writing poems inside these rituals many new ideas for writing<br>
      will reveal themselves. We take many of our daily movements for granted:<br>
      going to the refrigerator for instance. The possibilities of the fridge and freezer<br>
      are endless. You could hold an empty drinking glass against the side of it and<br>
      study the sound of its motor. Use a magnifying glass to examine the exterior and<br>
      interior in ways you had never done before. Use binoculars to sit across the room<br>
      to look at it very carefully while far away. Close your eyes and smell the inside.<br>
      With your eyes closed feel the contents, taste them. Take notes throughout the<br>
      process of a daily exploration of the refrigerator.</p>
    <p>Allow poetry to become an integral and necessary part of your life. I have created<br>
       rituals tracking the garbage I produce in a week, another involving homemade<br>
       star constellations, or experiencing what the impact of hearing the word "drone"<br>
       has on the human body, and many others from talking with trees, ghosts, or<br>
       translating Shakespeare's sonnets with crystals. My boyfriend Earth was brutally<br>
       tortured, raped and murdered, and I created a ritual to overcome my depression,<br>
       while other rituals became political actions on the streets. As far as I know,<br>
       there are no limits to what is possible.</p>
    <h4>2: Taking the Notes</h4>
    <p>One thing I like to suggest is writing in notebooks with lined paper,<br>
      then completely disrespecting those lines. Write wildly, like a child,<br>
      for whatever we can do to strip away the various structures built to corral <br>
      our attention is vital to this particular process of note-taking where we<br>
      hope to find ourselves wholly present and not troubled over lines on paper<br>
      and other concerns we have been trained to obey.</p>
    <p>Our internal editor is one we have built upon since we first learned to communicate,<br>
      reaching for the milk, the shiny earring, the hovering gull, eventually acquiring<br>
      the tools for constructing proper syntax, the uses of punctuation, etc. Our internal<br>
      editors are invaluable for shaping our poems, but they do get in the way of these raw<br>
      notes we write inside the ritual. When taking notes, as soon as the mind forms full<br>
      sentences, or follows a thread of an idea, write faster. We can outrun the internal<br>
      editor, to fully trust ourselves in the middle of the ritual, and to arrive at that<br>
      moment where all rebuke over words and their customs falls away. It is here where we<br>
      can cruise into the previously unimagined magical writing we had concealed from ourselves.</p>
    <p>Sometimes when attempting to write ahead of our editor we get caught in mind loops,<br>
      thought and language patterns that keep circling on themselves. Here are three tools <br>
      for breaking out of mind loops:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Inhale coffee beans or grounds. This tool recalibrates the olfactory and can jolt<br>
        us out of a mind loop we find ourselves caught inside while writing.</li>
      <li>If the coffee does not work stare straight ahead at an immobile object, then flick<br>
        the tip of your nose with your finger. Do it just hard enough that it disrupts your<br>
        visual pattern.  This tool often helps release us to go back to writing.</li>
      <li>If your mind loop is pernicious and not wanting to let go of you, then stand up and<br>
        wildly thrash-dance, especially kicking your legs in the air as high as you can.<br>
        This tool always works.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h4>3: Shaping the Poem</h4>
    <p>NOTE: It is essential to do this next phase in one sitting.</p>
    <p>Take your handwritten notes to a computer and open a writing document, Word or<br>
      whatever software you use for writing. Click on the page to make sure it is ready<br>
      to be used, then shut the screen light all the way off; this is to preclude our<br>
      need to be watchful for typos. Position your fingers on the keys, have your feet<br>
      flat, then close your eyes and type as fast as you can for five minutes, and same<br>
      rules apply as with the handwritten notes: as soon as the mind forms full sentences,<br>
      or follows a thread of an idea, type faster.</p>
    <p>At the end of the five minutes of blind speed-typing, turn the screen light back on,<br>
      then begin transferring the handwritten notes where you left off with the speed-typing.<br>
      In other words, this ultimately works better when it is one unbroken document. When<br>
      you reach the midway point of the handwritten notes, shut the screen light back off,<br>
      and repeat the steps for blind speed-typing. I usually earmark the midway page ahead<br>
      of time, make an X or checkmark. When the blind speed-typing is complete, turn the<br>
      light back on and transfer the remaining half of your handwritten notes. When this is<br>
      finally finished turn the screen light off and repeat the speed-typing once again.</p>
    <p>The blind speed-typing will expand the notes for the poem. The first bout of it<br>
      unleashes whatever language we have stored in us at the moment. The second and <br>
      especially the third times are after we have been rereading and transferring our <br>
       handwritten notes, our memories tripped over and over with images of the experience <br>
       of doing the ritual. These bouts of the blind speed-typing tend to enrich and compound <br>
       the notes in ways that often hold unexpected, crucial language for the poem.</p>
    <p>Print out two copies of this chaotic looking document. Hide one from yourself for a month.<br>
      Carry the other with you wherever we go with a highlighter pen, marking favorite nuggets<br>
      of writing for the poem. These pieces can then be culled by copying and pasting them into<br>
      a new document to begin shaping the poem. It all starts to come together on its own at<br>
      this stage, awakening the internal editor to help build the poem. The second copy you hid<br>
      from yourself for a month can be taken out of hiding and read backward: the last word typed<br>
      is the first word read and the first word typed is the last word read. Reading the document<br>
      backward often uncovers entirely new ways into the poem we would not have seen otherwise.</p>
