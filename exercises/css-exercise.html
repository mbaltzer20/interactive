		<h3>Websites as performance</h3>
		<p>As designers we write scripts for the players to act out. Technology reads the scripts and conveys the designer’s artistic direction. The viewer interacts with the performance’s content in a sequence the designer lays out. There is a beginning and end to the viewer’s visit. The viewer can stay for all of the content or leave in the middle. The viewer can direct their attention wherever they want, scrolling their eyes across the stage and screen. </p>

		<h3>Websites as flowers</h3>
		<p>You can stumble upon one and realize it’s beauty. You can directly seek one out by searching for it. There are flowers that belong in the same family but differ in physical appearance and genetic makeup.</p>

		<h3>Surfing the web as travel</h3>
		<p>We have a destination in mind when we browse. We when know the context of a location, we can walk there ourselves. When we know the context of a website, we can input the address ourselves. When we can’t reach a location manually, we use a vehicle. When we can’t reach a site manually, we use a search engine. The scenic route can take us down a rabbit hole of unexpected sites. </p>
